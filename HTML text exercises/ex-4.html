            The <!DOCTYPE> declaration is not an HTML tag; it is an instruction to the web browser about what version of HTML the page is written in.

        <font face="sans-serif">
            In HTML 4.01, the <!DOCTYPE> declaration refers to a DTD, because HTML 4.01 was based on SGML. The DTD specifies the rules for the markup language, so that the browsers render the content correctly.

        <font face="tahoma">
            HTML5 is not based on SGML, and therefore does not require a reference to a DTD.
